        When the rain is blowing in your face
        And the whole world is on your case
        I could offer you a warm embrace
        To make you feel my love

        When the evening shadows and the stars appear
        And there is no one there to dry your tears
        I could hold you for a million years
        To make you feel my love

        I know you haven't made your mind up yet
        But I will never do you wrong
        <span class="highlight"> I've known it from the moment that we met</span>
        <span class="highlight">No doubt in my mind where you belong </span>

        I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
        I'd go crawling down the avenue
        No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
        To make you feel my love

        The storms are raging on the rolling sea
        And on the highway of regret
        The winds of change are blowing wild and free
        You ain't seen nothing like me yet

        I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
        Nothing that I wouldn't do
        Go to the ends of the Earth for you
        To make you feel my love
        To make you feel my love
