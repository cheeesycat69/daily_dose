  Half of my heart is in H<span class="bolder">a</span>vana, ooh na-na (ayy, ayy)
  He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na, ah
  Oh, but my heart is in Havana (ayy)

  Havana, ooh-na-na (uh)
  He didn't walk up with that "how you doin'?" (uh)
  When he <span class="bolder">c</span>ame in the room
  He said there's a lot of girls _ can do with (uh)
  But I can't without you
  I knew him for<span class="bolder">e</span>ver in a minute (hey)
  That summer night in June
  And papa says he got malo in him (uh)
  He got me feelin' like...
  Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (ayy)
  I kn<span class="bolder">e</span>w it when I met him (ayy), I loved him when I left him
  Got me feelin' like, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
  And then I had to tell him, I had to go
  Oh-na-na-na-na-na (woo)
  Havana, ooh na-na (ayy, ayy)
  Half of my heart is in <span class="bolder"><b>H</b></span>avana, ooh na-na (ayy, ayy)
  He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na (uh huh)
  Oh, but my heart is in Havana (ayy)
  My heart is in Havana (ayy)
  Havana, ooh-na-na

  Back it on me (back it up)
  <span style="color:purple;" class="bolder">S</span>hawty cravin' on me, get to eatin' on me (on me)
  She waited on me (then what?)
  Shawty cakin' on me, got the bacon on me (wait up)
  This is history in the makin', on me (on me)
  Point blank, close range, that B
  If it cost a million, that's me (that's me)
  I was gettin' mula, baby
  Havana, ooh na-na (ayy, ayy)
  Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh na-na (oh, ayy, ayy)
  He took me back (uh huh) to East Atlanta, na-na-na (oh, no)
  Oh, but my heart is in Havana (ayy)
  My heart is in Havana (ayy)
  Havana, ooh-na-na
