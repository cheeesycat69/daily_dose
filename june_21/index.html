        Wise men say
        Only fools rush in
        But I can't help falling in love with you
        Shall I stay?
        Would it be a sin
        If I can't help falling in love with you?

        Like a river flows
        Surely to the sea
        Darling, so it goes
        Some things are meant to be

        Take my hand
        Take my whole life, too
        For I can't help falling in love with you

        Like a river flows
        Surely to the sea
        Darling, so it goes
        Some things are meant to be

        Take my hand
        Take my whole life, too
        For I can't help falling in love with you
        For I can't help falling in love with you
